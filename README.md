Garduino
========

Components
----------
* [Moisture sensor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pm83L104naY)
* Humidity and Temperature (DHT11) - see the Arduino libraries folder, then dht and there is an exmaple of how to use it
* Light (LDR) - 

Todo
----
* Plant profiles for optimized growing of specific herbs
* dht.getStatusString() returns TIMEOUT when connection problem and OK when connection is working. Maybe check for these values
* Water level sensor for the reservoir
* Add pH sensor
* Button to force start watering
* Add status lights for pump (in a later stage maybe switch to a rgb led or something that can represent the health of the plant)
* Add solar panel to power the arduino
* Buy water proof box for the electronics
